# Module-Scanning-Weak-Anticheat
Detect unauthorized modules injected into sensitive applications
This project is a Windows-based process scanner designed to monitor and detect potentially suspicious or external modules loaded by a specific process. The scanner checks for indicators of suspicious activity, such as modules loaded from unusual directories (e.g., Temp or Desktop) and performs validation against a remote server to identify non-Win32 modules.
